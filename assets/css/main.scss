/* This file serves as the entry point for the website's styling and imports all other Sass files located in _sass
* You can import as many Sass files from the _sass/ directory as you want
* By default, all files inside assets/ will be copied to the _site folder during the build process. In addition to that, the Sass files must be compiled to CSS. 
* The two dashed lines (empty front matter) at the beginning of main.scss signal Jekyll to compile them, rather than simply copying the files
*
* To include only parts of bootstrap, follow option B here:
* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/sass/
* Follow this tutorial to add bootstrap to a jekyll website
* https://blog.robinkloeckner.com/how-to-add-bootstrap-5-sass-to-jekyll */
