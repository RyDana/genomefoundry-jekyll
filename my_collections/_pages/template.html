This is a template of a separate page for the Genome Foundry website. 

This page's info can be accessed, by any other page, through Liquid notation like this: 

{% assign pages = site.pages | where: 'url', '/template' %}
{% for page in pages %}
        <a href="{{ page.url }}">
        {{ page.title }} has the {{ page.layout }} layout
        </a>
        <p>{{ page.content | markdownify}}</p>
{% endfor %}

If separate pages are wished to be used, Scrollspy should stop being used in the navigation bar.

Additionally, you would need to un-comment the declaration of this collection, its default front-matter values, in the _config.yml
