##### Scope

The Concordia Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology (CASB) is Canada’s first research centre focused on Synthetic Biology. The Centre houses the Genome Foundry for Synthetic Biology, a unique CFI- and NRC-funded technology platform that aspires to accelerate the design-build-test cycle of biological engineering (www.concordia.ca/casb).

The Centre has an urgent need for multiple Research Assistants with a background in applied synthetic biology. The Research Assistants are needed to support the microbial genome engineering activities of the Genome Foundry. These activities include but are not limited to high-throughput genome editing using the Genome Foundry’s automation and LIMS platforms.

The Research Assistants will report to the Microbial Suite Platform Coordinator, Nicholas Gold, and set priorities in consultation with the Centre Director, Dr. Vincent Martin, and Genome Foundry Platform Coordinators.

These are key positions of the Genome Foundry; the Research Assistants will need to display a high level of initiative, drive, and accountability.
